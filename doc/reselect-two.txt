INTRODUCTION                                    *reselect-two*

This plugin extends the capacity of *gv* |reselect-Visual| which allows you to
restore the last visual selection by making it possible to restore the
penultimate visual selection.

This plugin allows you to restore, not only the last selection area (like does
the *gv* |reselect-Visual|) but also the previous one: the penultimate
selection area (with *gV*).

MAPPINGS                                        *reselect-two-mappings*

*gv* Start Visual mode with the same area as the previous area and the same
mode. See |reselect-Visual|

*gV* Start Visual mode with the same area as the penultimate area and the same
mode.

  Visual Selection          Visual Reselection ~
  "[HELL]o world!"          *gv* -> [HELL],   *gV* -> [HELL]
  "hello [WORLD]!"          *gv* -> [WORLD],  *gV* -> [HELL]
  "[HELLO] world!"          *gv* -> [HELLO],  *gV* -> [WORLD]
